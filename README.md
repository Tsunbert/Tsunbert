Exploring the intersection of econometrics, data science, and technology. This space contains projects and code related to quantitative finance, ESG, AI/ML, and automation, often implemented in Python and R. I focus on understanding the underlying algorithms and striving for robust implementations. I'm also a research assistant at Business Economics Data Science Laboratory in Bucharest, where I tackle diverse topics ranging from quantitative finance to ESG and more.
